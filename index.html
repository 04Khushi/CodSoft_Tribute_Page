      <h2>About Bhagat Singh</h2>
      <p>
        Bhagat Singh was a prominent freedom fighter and revolutionary leader who was born on September 28, 1907, in a small village in Punjab, India. He grew up in a family of freedom fighters and was deeply influenced by the prevailing political and social climate during the British Raj. 
        At a young age, Bhagat Singh joined the struggle for India's independence and became a vocal critic of British colonial rule.
        He was a member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) and was involved in several acts of protest against British rule, including the Central Legislative Assembly Bombing in 1929.
        Bhagat Singh's commitment to the cause of freedom and his fearless actions have made him an iconic figure in the Indian independence movement.
